# Polynesian Seas

**Polynesian Seas** is an educational exploration game where players navigate a traditional Polynesian sailboat across various islands, learning about Polynesian culture through interactions with navigators. Developed using Unity, this project aimed to create an engaging experience for children aged 6 to 9, introducing them to the rich heritage of Polynesia.

## Features
- **Island Exploration**: Sail between islands such as Hawaii, Samoa, Mo'orea, and Tahiti.
- **Cultural Interaction**: Engage in dialogues with navigators to uncover cultural insights and sailing techniques.
- **Navigation Aids**: Utilize tools like the navigation arrow, notebook, and star compass to assist in exploration.
- **Educational Content**: Designed to educate young players about Polynesian culture in an interactive manner.

## Development Highlights
- **Dialogue System**: Implemented using Ink, a narrative scripting tool by Inkle, allowing designers to craft interactive dialogues without direct coding involvement. This system facilitated the creation of variables and dynamic narrative paths within the game.
- **Navigation Mechanics**: Developed intuitive navigation aids tailored for young players, including:
  - **Navigation Arrow**: Displays when the player is distant from an island, guiding them towards their destination.
  - **Notebook**: Keeps track of visited and unvisited islands, enhancing exploration and discovery.
  - **Star Compass**: Introduces players to traditional Polynesian navigation by incorporating a compass feature obtainable within the game.
- **Iterative Development**: Engaged in multiple QA testing sessions, refining the game based on feedback to ensure age-appropriate difficulty and educational value.
- **Cultural Research**: Conducted thorough research to accurately represent Polynesian culture, ensuring respectful and informative content.
- **Documentation**: Authored a comprehensive technical planning document detailing systems, mechanics, and design processes, fostering effective collaboration among team members.

## What I Learned
This project underscored the importance of cultural research and representation in game development. It challenged me to think differently about gameplay mechanics to suit a younger audience while maintaining educational value. Additionally, it provided an opportunity to enhance my UI programming skills, particularly in developing the dialogue system.
